# What is it?

The photo site [500px.com](http://500px.com) has gorgeous pictures, but no way to easily traverse
through the full-size images without losing the pictures list context. With this bookmarklet
installed into your browser toolbar, you can navigate to lists like:

* [http://500px.com/popular?only=Landscapes](http://500px.com/popular?only=Landscapes), or
* [http://500px.com/favorites/week](http://500px.com/favorites/week)

And then, with one click, view the slide show of the "Popular Landscapes", or "Top Week Favorites"
pictures respectively. Also works with a selected photographer's profile page, or with your own
"Favorites" list. For now, only the current page's photos are displayed.
