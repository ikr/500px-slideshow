# What is it?

The photo site [500px.com](http://500px.com) has gorgeous photos, but no way to easily traverse
through the full-size images without losing the photos list context. With this bookmarklet installed
into your browser toolbar, you can navigate to lists like:

* [http://500px.com/popular](http://500px.com/popular),
* [http://500px.com/editors](http://500px.com/editors), or
* [http://500px.com/favorites/week](http://500px.com/favorites/week)

And then, with one click, view the slide show of all the "Popular", "Editor's choice", or "Top Week
Favorites" pictures respectively.

Should also work with a selected photographer profile page, or with your own "Favorites" list.
