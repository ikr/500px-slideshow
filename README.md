# What is it?

The photo site [500px.com](http://500px.com) has gorgeous pictures, but no way to easily traverse
through the full-size images without losing the pictures list context. With this bookmarklet
installed into your browser toolbar, you can navigate to lists like:

* [http://500px.com/popular](http://500px.com/popular),
* [http://500px.com/editors](http://500px.com/editors), or
* [http://500px.com/favorites/week](http://500px.com/favorites/week)

And then, with one click, view the slide show of the "Popular", "Editor's choice", or "Top Week
Favorites" pictures respectively. For now, only the current page's photos are displayed.

Also works with a selected photographer's profile page, or with your own "Favorites" list.
